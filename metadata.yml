Title: Antimicrobial class specificity prediction
Description: Prediction of antimicrobial class specificity using simple machine learning
  methods applied to an antimicrobial knowledge graph. The knowledge graph is built
  on ChEMBL, Co-ADD and SPARK. Endpoints are broad terms such as activity against
  gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. The best model according to the authors
  is a Random Forest with MHFP6 fingerprints.
Mode: Pretrained
Task: Classification
Input: Compound
Input Shape: Single
Output: Probability
Output Type: Float
Output Shape: List
Interpretation: Class probabilities for each antimicrobial class
